This is my homepage. You can learn more about me on this page. However, I just started building it, so it will take some time.

My primary research interest centers on applying multi-disciplinary models into biological research. I am taking advantage of deep learning to transfer phase-contrast images of Myxococcus xanthus into fluorescent images, which can be easily interpreted to cell density maps. I am also working on extracting Myxo cell aggregation features, which will be helpful to cluster mutant strains into different genetic pathways.
